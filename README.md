2. Research Brief â€“ Consensus View & Conflicting Opinions

- After submitting a query, the system generates a structured research brief:

- Consensus View: A synthesized summary of the overall market opinion.

- Conflicting Opinions: Contradictory perspectives (e.g., growth potential vs. margin pressures).

- This ensures that users see both the broad agreement and the nuances in analyst reports.
