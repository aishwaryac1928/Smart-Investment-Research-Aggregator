## How to Run

### 1. Backend (FastAPI)
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# Activate venv:
#   Linux/Mac: source venv/bin/activate
#   Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000


### 2. Frontend (React)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Frontend will run at: http://localhost:3000
(Connects automatically to FastAPI backend)

### ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + CSS

- Backend: FastAPI + Uvicorn

- AI Integration: Text synthesis + contradiction detection

- Data: Mock CSV research data


### ðŸ”® Future Improvements

- Integrate real financial APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance).

- Add authentication for personalized dashboards.

- Store data in a database instead of CSV.

- Implement caching for faster repeat queries.

- Use LLM summarization for smarter aggregation of research text.

- Add unit & integration tests with CI/CD pipeline.


## ðŸ“¸ Frontend Walkthrough

1. Landing Page â€“ Input Form

- The user is presented with a simple and clean interface.

- Two input fields: Company Name and Ticker Symbol.

- A "Get Research Brief" button triggers the research aggregation process.

- The design is minimal and intuitive, making it easy for analysts to start their research.

2. Research Brief â€“ Consensus View & Conflicting Opinions

- After submitting a query, the system generates a structured research brief:

- Consensus View: A synthesized summary of the overall market opinion.

- Conflicting Opinions: Contradictory perspectives (e.g., growth potential vs. margin pressures).

- This ensures that users see both the broad agreement and the nuances in analyst reports.

3. Research Brief â€“ Confidence Score & Export

- The detailed brief also includes:

- Confidence Score: AI-estimated measure of reliability for the consensus.

- Key Risks: Highlighting potential downside factors and uncertainties.

- Export Feature: A button to Export as DOCX, allowing users to save and share the research brief in a professional format.
